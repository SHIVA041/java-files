1>how to create constants in java
      ordinary variable into constants we have to use keyword final.
2>how many types of datatype in java
  there are 2 types of datatypes in java
  premutive and non premutive
  premutive byte,short,long,boolean,char,float,double,int.
  non premutive String
 3>Because in java every datatype is strictly defined
 4>*can be a alfabet
   *can be a number 
   *can be _and $ symbol
   *can't start with number   
 5>Declaring a variable with datatypes
 6>Array is a group of similar or homogenious type of datatype in the single unit.
 7>no array follows index so it start from 0th location
 8>array stored in stack memory
 9>we can store multiple number of values in single unit.
10>An array without any name is known as anonymous array
  exampkle==int Array[] = new int[2];
                Array[0] = 1254;  
				  Array[1] = 1151;  
				   Array[2] = 1515;
11>write a program to print an array.
  class Tranee1{
		public static void main(String a[]){
        String [] names = {"girish","shivu","pavan","manish","manohar","pooja","shwetha","sachitra","geetha","anusha","megha"};
		
		System.out.println(names[0]);
		System.out.println(names[1]);
		System.out.println(names[2]);
		System.out.println(names[3]);
		System.out.println(names[4]);
		System.out.println(names[5]);
		System.out.println(names[6]);
		System.out.println(names[7]);
		System.out.println(names[8]);
		System.out.println(names[9]);
		System.out.println(names[10]);
		
		}
}		   
12>write a program to sort an array in java
  public class Sort {    
    public static void main(String[] args) {        
             
        int [] arr = new int [] {5, 2, 8, 7, 1};     
        int temp = 0;    
              System.out.println("Elements of original array: ");    
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {     
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");    
        }    
            //Sort the array in ascending order    
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {     
            for (int j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {     
               if(arr[i] > arr[j]) {    
                   temp = arr[i];    
                   arr[i] = arr[j];    
                   arr[j] = temp;    
               }     
            }     
        }    
		System.out.println();
		
		    //Displaying elements of array after sorting    
        System.out.println("Elements of array sorted in ascending order: ");    
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {     
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");    
        }    
    }    
}    
13>
14>write a program to throw arrayoutofboundexception
15>what happen if u dont initialize an array
    it will initialize its own array of 0th location and give default values
16>find the smallest and largest number in a given array
  class FindLargestSmallestNumberMain {
 
           public static void main(String[] args) {
 
 
 int arr[] = new int[]{12,56,76,89,100,343,21,234};
 int smallest = arr[0];
 int largest = arr[0];
 
 for(int i=1; i< arr.length; i++)
 {
 if(arr[i] > largest)
 largest = arr[i];
 else if (arr[i] < smallest)
 smallest = arr[i];
 
 }
 System.out.println("Smallest Number is : " + smallest);
 System.out.println("Largest Number is : " + largest); 
 }
}
 
17>static is a keyword in java which is used to make any mehod,variable and class staic
   the variable which is declared by the word static inside the class and outside the mehod.
   the mehod which is declared by the keyword static is known as static mehod
18>we can overload the static mehods which have same name and different in parameters or method singnature.
   we can't override the static mehod
19>because compiler can call main mehod without creating an object it saves the memory
20>block which co ntains static keyword
21>no constuctors can not be static static used for class more than a object
22>yes interface has static methods also.
23>process of calling sequence of constuctors in class is known as constuctor chaining 
   by using this(); and super();
24>constuctor is blocks of codes similar to method which is only called when used instace or non static class created
25>it show error because constuctor dont have any return type
26>no we can not calls sub class constuctor in super class
